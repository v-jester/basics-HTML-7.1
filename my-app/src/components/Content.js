        Oslo is the capital of Norway, located on the southern coast of the
        country at the northern tip of the Oslofjord. The city is known for its
        parks and museums, many of which are located on the Bygd√∏y Peninsula. In
        Oslo, it is worth visiting the Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Viking
        Ship Museum, where wooden ships from the 9th century are exhibited. The
        jump at Holmenkollen, which boasts the world's oldest ski museum, offers
        beautiful views of the fjord.
